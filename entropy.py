SecretSweep — Shannon Entropy Calculator

Calculates Shannon entropy of a string to help distinguish real secrets
(high entropy, random-looking) from false positives (low entropy, 
repetitive or patterned strings).

Shannon entropy for a string of base64/hex characters:
- Random 40-char hex string:   ~3.9 to 4.0 bits
- Random 40-char base64:       ~5.0 to 5.5 bits
- "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa":    0.0 bits
- "abcabcabcabcabcabcabc":    ~1.58 bits
- "password1234567890123":     ~3.7 bits (borderline)

Typical thresholds used in our patterns:
- 0.0 = skip entropy check (prefix-anchored patterns don't need it)
- 1.5 = very permissive (catches most non-trivial strings)
- 3.0 = moderate (filters obvious patterns and repetition)
- 3.5 = strict (most real secrets pass, most false positives don't)
- 4.0 = very strict (only high-quality random strings)
